# _Horoscope Random Message Generator:_
## Summary
I created 3 arrays of words to be put in the horoscope to generate the random messages. 
I then created a function that will pick a random word from each of the arrays using math.random and math.floor and multiplied math.random
with the array length. later I concatenated the generated words with the built sentence and used the return method. Once the function was 
called and logged to the console with the 3 arrays the message was generated.
